The Personal Task Manager (PTM) is a simple, intuitive task management tool designed to help individuals organize and prioritize their tasks, habits, and goals. This open-source project allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks with due dates and priorities, categorize tasks into customizable categories (e.g., work, personal, habits), and set long-term goals with associated tasks. Additionally, PTM features a habit tracker for monitoring daily activities and sends reminders for upcoming deadlines.
